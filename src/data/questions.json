I\ndidn't expect a job to come up straight away as I haven't got loads of experience.\nStefanos: Have you always wanted to be an engineer?\nJulie: No!

I mean, is it hard to start a business?\nStefanos: It's not easy, but I think I can do it.

Well,\nhe was standing by the fountain in the park, filling up water bottles and telling people to buy this water for a\ndollar if they want to be strong like him. I mean, it's the same water that comes into your house, and he\ncharged one dollar for that!\nPresenter: Is Mr Strong still doing this, Carol?\nCaller 1: I don't think so – as I say, it's just something I heard about from my neighbour.\nPresenter: Interesting! Thank you, Carol. Let's take Caller 2. Is this Martin from Philadelphia?\nCaller 2: Hiya, I'm Martin. I just want to say, I love your show.\nPresenter: Oh, well thank you, Martin! So what can you tell us about an unusual thing someone has done to earn money?\nCaller 2: When I was on holiday last year, down in Florida, there were people on the beach offering to peel your fruit.\nFor money. Not sell it – you give them your fruit, and they just peel it. And it cost as much as the fruit itself!\nPresenter: What kind of fruit are you talking about, Martin?\nCaller 2: Well, any fruit. I saw them with pineapples, which, let's face it, aren't easy to peel. But there was someone\nthere offering to cut melons, and one little guy even offered to peel bananas! Crazy, I say!\nPresenter: Well, thank you for that Martin! Caller 3. I haven't got your name. Can you tell us your name and where you're\nfrom?\nCaller 3: Oh, hello! I'm Eileen and I'm from New York.\nPresenter: Hi Eileen. What's your story today?\nCaller 3: Well, it's actually about me. Is that OK?

We are Melvin\nDesigners, and we design things like garden chairs, tables, benches, that kind of thing and we're based in\nValencia House, on High Road, just round the corner. I started the business in 2014 with a friend, then, little by\nlittle, we grew and then we moved to Valencia House in 2016. When we moved to Valencia House, which is in a\nmodern office building in the centre, we realised the running costs were a lot more expensive than our older\noffice outside the city and we just had to cut down on our costs.\nWhen we looked more closely at where we could save money, we realised we didn't need to print every single\nemail that came through. So, in February 2017, we made a plan to use less paper. Surprisingly, we managed to\ncut the amount of paper we were using by 50%. We've now decided to set a target of using just 30% of our\noriginal paper use.\nWe then quit the habit of buying coffee from a café in single-use cups, you know, the cups you can only use\nonce, and took our own cups instead. Avoiding single-use cups gave us a 10 % discount. 'Wow! Isn't this\ngreat,' said my partner, 'let's look at other things we can do.' So, he looked at what we threw away, things like\nprinter cartridges, packaging for materials we ordered, and tried to think of ways of recycling or reusing\nthem. He found a recycling company on the internet who would come and collect industrial cardboard,\nplastic, that kind of thing, and actually pay us for it!\nWe have a few more ideas, but I can't share them with you just yet I'm afraid! However, we do have things\nwhich we are going to introduce over the next month or so at Valencia House. Does anyone in the audience\ntoday compost? By composting, I mean throwing all their waste food in a box and then putting it in their\ngardens for their flowers and plants? Well, I must admit, this did seem a little strange to me at first, but a\nmember from the design team suggested it as a way to cut down on the amount of waste we throw in the bins,\nwhich is another way of reducing our costs. We estimate that our bins will be 10% lighter without food waste\nand we will be able to use the compost on the rose bushes at the front of our building.\nSo, if you want to cut down on.",

      "content": "Digital nomads are people who travel around the world using telecommunications technology to allow them to earn a living.\n\nRemote Working – Good or Bad?\n'The world is my office', Jane proclaims with some pride. Jane is part of a digital revolution that has been changing the way we work and, more importantly, where we work. She is part of a group called digital nomads who are riding the tech wave into the future and in the process changing how many jobs can be done from anywhere in the world.\n\nThis seems to be old news as a company's office location generally doesn't dictate where the business is performed. What is different is that the digital nomad doesn't have an office – they have portable tools. 'You can do pretty much any job anywhere these days, although it's not a new thing', Jane continues to explain, 'with my mobile and laptop I can work anywhere at any time'. Her favourite place to work this month is by a beach not far from her rented beach house on the edge of the Indian Ocean.\n\nIt sounds like a perfect way to work, but what, if any, are the downsides? Firstly, there is the fact that a lot of the time you may end up working for a company that expects you to be available during office hours in their country. So, if you're working for an Australian company whilst living in Europe, the time difference will have a severe impact on your life. Secondly, it doesn't mean less work. Often you have to work a regular nine-to-five schedule, but as with any job you may need to put in some extra hours to get everything done.\n\nAs Jane explains, 'I often work very long hours that are no different from what I used to do before I left the traditional office. Being a nomad just means that I can choose where I work, not how much or when, and this is a mistake I see a lot of new nomads making'. Jane went on to tell me that last year she nearly gave it all up because she was working from a village in Portugal and realised that she hadn't actually had time to see any part of the country except where she had set up a base. 'Realising where I went wrong last year was a big step for me. I have now revisited what I wanted from my life and decided that I needed to do less so I could get more from where I was living at the time'.",

I'm not sure I have ever really been to a café for any reason other than a warm\ndrink. I don't always have a coffee, but I think there are other places I'd rather work. For me, I don't understand how\npeople can work in such a noisy environment, although sometimes I do wish I had the opportunity not to be in the\noffice all the time.\nFred\n\nUntil about a year ago, I had never been in a café. I always thought they were a waste of money and I knew that I could\nmake a better coffee myself, and with more care, than someone else in a shop. All that has changed since I moved\naway to go to college though. I generally go to cafés to meet up with mates, and we chat and plan what we're going to\ndo. It's definitely a place I go to socialise rather than anything else.\nSerena\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to always meet my friends at a café on my way home from school. We used to think we were\nall very adult and would have coffees and teas – using up our pocket money in no time at all. I learnt a lot about the\nvalue of money and how easy it is to spend when it is so difficult to make. Nowadays, I still frequent a few cafés in my\narea, but I rarely spend more than a couple of euros and spend hours catching up with people.\nJune\n\nI've never really been into the café culture, probably because the area I lived in as a kid had nothing like that around.\nWhen I started to work for myself, I used to spend all day in a café on the corner of the road I lived on. After the first\nyear, I realised that perhaps I would be more productive if I worked somewhere else because in the end so many\nregulars knew me and I ended up chatting with them more than working.

More than four billion people around the world make the claim that (0) they are fans of at least one team. Although far fewer people are fans of other sports, it seems that there is nobody on the planet who isn't a fan of at least one.\n\nWhy are people so eager to support a team when it is often based far from where they live, and they have never travelled to see where (1) it is based? Sports psychologists have studied the question in detail and have reached a few conclusions. Interestingly, it seems that one of the reasons why games like football are so popular is social connectedness. The supporters feel they have a connection to the team, club and quite possibly that (2) they know all the other fans. This means, for example, that there would be a natural connection between two people wearing the same football shirt, which transcends race, religion, gender and social status. What surprises most is the closeness that (3) this feeling brings.\n\nWhy is the pull so strong? If we were to take a closer look you would see that clubs have developed huge marketing campaigns – the most popular football club in the world came from a small town in the north of England and has supporters numbering in the millions all around the world. Most of the fans have never been to the UK nor seen many of the matches on the television. (4) They have nothing to do with the city, apart from the love of the team.\n\nThe overriding feeling amongst most fans is that (5) their success is my success. Popular teams are invariably ones that spend a lot of time winning. The rise in the fan base for a team that is winning is usually driven by the sentiment of the fans. This means that the fans tie the team's success to their own. They react in the same way as if it were personal success or failure depending on if the team win or lose. If the team goes through a long losing streak, then, generally, individual players will be homed in on as the 'representative' of oneself.",

Considering the amount of different types of soil available, I would suggest going to your local (2) nursery and finding out from a member of staff what will work best for the plants you intend to buy or, better yet, you can ask when you by them. They will know because they grow young plants for sale in top condition.\n\nWeeding and cleaning: This is a job that many people hate, but is an integral part of gardening. Keeping back the weeds helps your plants get more of the nutrients they need for growth and cleaning the soil around them helps keep it dry so no mould appears that can (3) irreparably damage the roots and you'll have to start again, which is both sad and time consuming.\n\nFeeding: Just like you, your plants will want a variety of food at different times in their life cycle. Many plants will survive in a good soil only, but if you have fruit, vegetables or flowers you will want to supplement the soil to get the maximum (4) yield from your crop. To my mind it is always better to get as much as you can from your plants; the feeling of success when you have a large crop is great.\n\nWatering: Different plants need different amounts of (5) moisture. This is an absolute fact and what is dry for some is wet for others so be careful not to mix up how much and how often you should be watering. Also, if you live in certain parts of the country the acidity of the water changes so it might be best to check this because it will have a big impact on how the roots can grow.",
